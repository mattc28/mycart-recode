All items must be stored in Javascript, not in the HTML DOM. Later on, items will be loaded from a URL in JSON format

A loading spinner should be shown until all items have been loaded.

Out of stock items should not be able to be added to the cart

For now, we can prefill with Frozen Chicken Breasts.

Work in pairs.

Javascript things you will need to use:
	DOM Manipulation.
		getElementById
		getElementsByClassName 
		.innerHTML
		.onClick
	Arrays
	AJAX
	Promises


You will be graded on this, on how closely you match the design, and your code quality.

No buttons need functionality other than Add, and clicking the cart button should show the cart dropdown.

All assets should be provided, if any are missing, suitable replacements will suffice.
